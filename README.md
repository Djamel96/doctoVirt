# Doctovirt Mobile App

DoctoVirt, or Doctor Virtual. Is a mobile application that will connect patients and doctors from all around the world. The doctors first subscribe and get their profile validated, then can choose if they offer free or paid consultations. Patients will use the app to search for a specialized doctor and call him if he is available for online consultation. The app can also be used by not experienced doctors to get mentored by experienced doctors. This will solve a lot of health problems all around the world !

# App Content
We build this app with love for humanity. Every person on this earth deserve the best healthcare. We first designed all the app and what it should contain. We made it simple to be accessible for everyone. The user will choose if he is a patient or doctor then click next. If he choose patient, he will see the list of doctors, and he can search by name or by specialty. Some doctors offer free consultations, other can choose to get paid. If the user choose that he is a doctor, he first need to subscribe. We verify his profile and we send him email for extra steps and verification. Then he can login and see the requesting calls from the patients. We used Agora to implement the video calls and it gave an awesome result !

# Code structure
